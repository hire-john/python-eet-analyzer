#EET Circuits Analyzer

This is a basic circuit analyzer I'll be developing in conjunction
with my University studies. The purpose is to help reinforce the material
by requriing a deeper understanding of the methods by translating them into
Python. The code is not entirely "professional" at this time but I am learning
Python simulatanoesly with this project and will improve overtime with experience,
practice, and many refactors.
