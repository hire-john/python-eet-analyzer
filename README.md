# EET Circuits Analyzer

This is a basic circuit analyzer I'll be developing in conjunction with my University studies. The purpose is to help reinforce the material by requiring a deeper understanding of the methods by translating them into Python. The code is not entirely "professional" at this time but I am learning Python simultaneously ith this project and will improve overtime with experience, practice, and many refactors. 

So far it covers very fundamental circuit analysis of simple 

* Series Circuits
* Parallel Circuits
* Series-Parallel Circuits

Utilizing laws and forumulas such as Ohm's Law and Current and Voltage Division Rules. There will be much more to be added as I progress through my Bachelor's of Eletrical Engineering Technology.
